Q: In your kernel implementation of tiled matrix multiplication, how many threads can be simultaneously scheduled for execution on a GeForce GTX-680 GPU, which contains 8 SMs?
------
From nvcc usage report: 

8448 smem
Used 21 Registers,
392 bytes cmem[0]
-------
From DeviceQuery tool from NVIDIA:

Total Shared Memory / Block = 49152 bytes
Total Registers / block = 65536
--------
Threads / block: 1024
---------

We have a total of 32 * 32, which sums up to 1024 Threads / Block.
Because the total shared memory used by one block is 8448 Bytes while the total
shared memory space available is 49152 Bytes, there can be only 5 blocks
executing at once, just based on the shared memory size limitations.

Another limitation that may occur is the number of registers used. There are a
total of 65536 registers in a block. Since each thread uses 21 registers, this
limits the number of threads per block to 65536 / 21 = 3120 threads. But
because there are only 1024 threads per block in our implementation, this
limitation does not affect the performance.

In summary, we can only use 5 blocks at once, so the total number of threads
that can be scheduled simultaneously is 8 * 5 * 1024 = 40960 threads.
